    question: "Do you provide the leads, or do I need to share my list?",

      "We handle everything – from prospect research and building targeted lead lists to running the outreach campaigns. You don’t need to bring your own list unless you want to.",

    question: "Will you manage replies and conversations too?",
    answer: "Yes. We can either manage the initial replies and pre-qualify prospects for you, or hand over the conversations directly to your sales team – whichever suits your workflow.",

    question: "How soon can I start seeing results?",
    answer:
      "Most clients start seeing responses and booked calls within the first 2–3 weeks of launch, depending on the niche and offer. Outreach compounds over time, so results usually improve month after month.",

    question: "Is this service suitable for my business?",
